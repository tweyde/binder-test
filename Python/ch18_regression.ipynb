    "\n",
    "So far, we have addressed machine learning with classification tasks, i.e. where there is a finite discrete set of target labels, the classes. The other main task in supervised machine learning is regression, where the task is to predict a continuous value. Regression leads to different metrics and algorithms, as well as some new concepts such as loss functions and regularization terms, as it is closer to optimization. "

    "### Loss Minimization vs Model Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation, as introduced in chapter 11, has the goal of finding the best parameter values for a model that represents the data generation process. \n",
    "In Machine Learning, the focus is typically more on the quality of the predictions generated by the model. \n",
    "The quality of the predictions is measured by a loss function, which describes the deviation of the predictions from the actual values we have observed. \n",
    "A lower loss value means a better quality of prediction and the machine learning process should therefore minimize the loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be equivalent to maximising a likelihood of the data under some assumptions and in a regression setting this is often the case.   \n",
    "In a regression setting, where we work with continuous values, we can use also calculus to find the optimial parameter values, which can be very effective. "

    "$$ \\nabla_w SSE = 2 (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X w} âˆ’ \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}) $$ \n",

    "$$ MSE = \\frac{SSE}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^N (y_n - \\hat{y}_n)^2. $$\n",
    "The MSE has the advantage over the SSE that it is comparable between datssets of differentsize. \n",
    "You may have noticed that the MES is the population variance if the mean of the residuals is 0. In other words, the variance of the data is the MSE of a predictor that predicts the mean of the labels. \n",

    "\n",
    "Both the overfitting and potential numerical problems can be addressed by regularization. \n",
    "The general concept of regularization as a way to reduce model flexibility, as introduced in the previous chapters, has very popular implementations for linear regression and related models, including general linear models (chapter 13) and neural networks. \n",
    "Because these models use numeric optimization methods, we can introduce additive terms in the loss function that relate to the model, that will be minimised together with the prediction loss. \n",
    "The most common such loss terms are $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms of the weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term norm describes ways of calculating the length of the vector. \n",
    "The standard norm is the Euclidian norm or $L_2$ norm, which can also be written as $|| \\mathbf{w} ||_2$, which is defined for a $D$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{w}$ as $\\sqrt{\\sum_{d=1}^D w_d^2}$ and describes the length in physical space for $d=3$. \n",
    "The $L_1$ norm is defined as $\\sum_{d=1}^D \\text{abs}(w_d)$, where $\\text{abs}$ sets the sign of the argument to positive. The $L_1$ norm can be interpreted as the distance on a rectangular grid and is also called the *Manhattan norm*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The $L_2$ norm regularizing loss $l_r$, also called Tikhonov regularization, is defined as follows: \n",
    "$$loss_2 = \\sum_d (\\hat{y}_d - y)^2 + \\sum_d (w_d)^2 = || \\mathbf{Xw} - \\mathbf{y} ||_2^2 + \\alpha || \\mathbf{w} ||_2^2 $$ \n",

    "\n",
    "Above we have used a polynomial extension of the model on the input side, by extracting interaction and quadratic combinations. \n",
    "When the parameters in these feature extractors are fixed, the model is still linear with respect to the feature values. \n",
    "However, using non-linear functions on the input side with learnable parameters is can make models much more flexibly while retaining control over the number of parameters in the model. \n",
    "This approach is used, e.g., in neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linear models, there is in general no closed-form solution available to fit the model parameters to the data. In the general case (so called non-convex optimisation problems) is not general algorithm for finding the optimal solution or even for knowing fi we found it. The most common idea for optimising non-linear models to use a technique called gradient descent. For this we calculate the gradient of our loss function with respect to the parameters. The gradient tells us whether the error will increase if we change the parameters in a particular direction by an arbitrarily small amount. By moving in the opostite direction, we hope to obtain a reduction in the loss. As the gradient changes size and direction as we change the paramters, we make only small changes as repeat the process until we find a gradient approaches zero and we cannot improve the error. In so-called convex problems, which include linear regression, this will lead us to an optimal solution. However, most linear models are not convex, so that we cannot be sure that change will lead us to the best solution. The main problem is that we may find a local minimum, which may be far from optimal. \n",
    "Despite these problems, for complex problems and large datasets, non-linear models tend to perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used continuous non-linear model are probably neural networks. We will start with a simple neural network for regression. It is like a linear regression with $k$ features, where each is the a linear combination of the input data followed by non-linear activation function $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = \\sum_k{ \\mathbf{w2}_k} f( \\sum_d \\mathbf{w1}_{kd} x_d ), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w1}$ is the weight vector the output, $\\hat{y}, and \\mathbf{w2}$ is the matrix of wheights for the $k$ features. Popular choices for $f$ are the logistic function that we used in chatper 13 for logistic function and the rectified linear function (ReLu): $ f(x) = \\max(0,x) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, the output and feature values are seen as the activation levels of connected neurons. These neurons were originally meant as modles of biological neurons, but today they are generally used as building blocks for computational learning systems. The neurons are organised in layers. In our case, there is an input layer, the input data, one hidden layer, the $k$ features, and the output layer, containing only our ouptut value. \n",
