In this first lesson, we will explore two basic data structures that are very useful: vectors and dataframes. Vectors are one dimensional and dataframes are two dimensional objects.  
But first, let's get the necessary software to begin coding.

# Getting Started with R
R is a free, open source software program for statistical analysis. First, download the R software from the following link.

[The R Project for Statistical Computing]( https://cran.r-project.org/)

RStudio is the most popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Download R Studio after you have installed R.

[R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop)  

Once you have installed these two, open R Studio and you should see the following.

# Simple Computations

Create a new script file (see the figure above). Let us begin with simple computations in R using `*`,`/`,`sqrt()`,`exp()`, and `log()` operators and functions. 

```{r}
25*77  
25/5  
sqrt(77)  
exp(2.5)  
log(55) 
```
 
# Creating Vectors

To create a vector, the appropriate syntax is `v = c()`. An example is:

```{r}
v = c(1,2,4,63,7,5)
```

To create a vector of a sequence, we use `seq()`.  

```{r}
vec1 = seq(1,5)
vec1
vec2 = seq(2,55,by = 3)
vec2
```

The option `by` in the sequence function allows you to increment by any value. 

To create a vector that repeats a number, character, or a vector of numbers or 
characters, we use `rep()`. Characters must be in quotations. 

```{r}
vec1 = rep(1,10)
vec1
vec2 = rep(c(3,4,5),3)
vec2
vec3 = rep("c",5)
vec3
```

The second element in parenthesis is the number of times you want the first 
element to be repeated. 

To find the sum of a vector, we use the command `sum()`.

```{r}
sum(vec1)
```

The following are other useful vector based functions in R.     

`min(x)` - minimum value of vector x    
`max(x)` - maximum value of vector x  
`mean(x)` - mean value of vector x  
`median(x)` - median value of vector x  
`quantile(x, p)` - pth quantile of vector x  
`sd(x)` - standard deviation of vector x  
`var(x)` - variance of vector x  
`IQR(x)` - Inter Quartile Range (IQR) of vector x  
`diff(range(x))` - total range of vector x  

Let us create three vectors to store information about weight, height, and gender. since gender is not numeric data, we use quotation marks when creating the vector.

Note that initially, the gender vector is character. This can be seen using the
`class()` command. The gender vector must be a factor (or more commonly refered to as 
categorical data) in order to be plotted, 
and thus we write `factor(gender)` in the parenthesis of the `plot()` command.

```{r}
weight = c(60,72,57,90,95,72)
height = c(1.75,1.8,1.65,1.9,1.74,1.91)
gender = c("m","f","m","f","f","m")
gender
class(gender)
```

Using the `plot()` command, we can plot these vectors as scatterplots or boxplots. The order within the parenthesis is the variable you want on the x axis, then the variable you want on the y axis. `col` can be used to change the color of the dots in a 
scatterplot, and `pch` changes the design of the dots. 

```{r}
plot(factor(gender),weight)
plot(weight,height,col = "red",pch=9)
```

# Creating Data Frames

A data frame is a two dimensional variable. To create a data frame called **ghw** using these three vectors, we use the command `data.frame()`. `View()` is a key command that allows you to see the data frame as a table in a separate tab. 

```{r}
ghw=data.frame(gender,height,weight)
ghw
View(ghw)
```

Now that the data frame is created, if you want to plot two variables from the 
data frame with the `plot()` command, you must specify both the data frame and 
the variable from the data frame. The appropriate syntax is, for example, 
`ghw$weight`, `ghw$height`, and `ghw$gender`. 

```{r}
plot(ghw$weight,ghw$height)
```

## Information about Data Frames

If you need a quick summary of the structure or contents of a data frame, there
are a few helpful commands. `summary()` gives you the min, max, mean, median, 
and 1st and 3rd quartiles of numerical data, and the length, class, and mode of 
categorical data. `dim()` gives you the number of rows and columns of your data
frame. `str()` gives you the first few elements of each variable. `head()` gives 
you the first few rows of the data frame. 

```{r}
summary(ghw)
dim(ghw)
str(ghw)
head(ghw)
```

To see the full data frame in another tab, use the `View()` command. 

```{r}
View(ghw)
```

## Adding Columns

You can add columns to a data frame based on the data from existing columns. Let's calcuate the Body Mass Index which is defined as:

$$ bmi = {{weight}\over{height^2}}$$

```{r}
ghw$bmi = ghw$weight/ghw$height^2
knitr::kable(ghw)
```
